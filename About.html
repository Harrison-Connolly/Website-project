<h2> I am 19 years old and I am in the second year of a Contemporary Art Degree at Wintec in Hamilton, New Zealand. I developed an interest in drawing and painting at a young age and while I was at primary school I had art lessons at the Waikato Society of Arts. I love nature, plants, birds and animals and this inspires my art and sculptures. </h2>
